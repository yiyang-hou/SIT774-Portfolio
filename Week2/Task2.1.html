    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Yiyang, I am currently studying <a href="#IT">Information Technology</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deakin.edu.au">Deaking University</a>. I have no prvious
        experience in this field, but I am always excited to learn new knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of my favourite quotes is by Confucian:
    <blockquote>
        When three are walking together, I am sure to find teachers among them. I will select their good qualities and
        follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.
    </blockquote>
    I like the quote because it reminds me to always try to learn new things from my surroundings.
